# Environment setup

(Intel Optane](https://www.acceleratewithoptane.com/access/) running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS & Linux 4.13.0-41-generic SMP x86_64.

Each host had two [Intel Xeon Gold 6142](https://ark.intel.com/products/120487/Intel-Xeon-Gold-6142-Processor-22M-Cache-2_60-GHz) & 20Gbps Bonded Network (2 Ã— 10Gbps w/ LACP).

We were running the following versions:

1. RabbitMQ v3.7.7 on Erlang/OTP v21.0.3
1. [PerfTest v2.2.0.M1](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-perf-test/releases/download/v2.2.0.M1/rabbitmq-perf-test-2.2.0.M1-bin.tar.gz) on Open JDK v1.8.0_171, RabbitMQ AMQP Java Client v5.3.0

We started with the following configuration:

At 73k msg/s we are hitting ...

## How does credit flow affect message latency (Erlang/OTP 21)?

Publish rate: 80000 msg/s

### {200, 100}

Erlang scheduler utilization was highest at `{200, 100}`:

```erlang

### {400, 200} (default)

| {400, 200} | 210ms    | 193ms    | 185ms    |

Erlang scheduler utilization at `{400, 200}`:

```erlang
recon:scheduler_usage(5000).
[{1,0.45632246662108844},

```

Going above the default `{400, 200}` credits resulted in over 200ms latency for 99th, 95th & 75th.
We suspect that this is related to Erlang/OTP 21 which removes the reduction penalty when sending messages to processes with large mailboxes.

## How does credit flow affect message latency (Erlang/OTP 20)?

## How do multiple consumers affect message latency?
## How do multiple producers affect message latency?
## How do multiple queues affect message latency?

## What are the effects of running multiple queues?

Publish rate: 10000 msg/s

We use 1 producer & 1 consumer per queue, so there will be multiple producers, consumers & queues.

Each producer and each consumer use their own connection & channel.

| Queues<br /> Producers<br /> Consumers | Msg/s per queue | Max 99th | Max 95th | Max 75th |
| -:                                     | -:              | -:       | -:       | -:       |
| 1                                      | 10000           | 2.88ms   | 1.56ms   | 0.942ms  |
| 2                                      | 5000            | 1.3ms    | 0.844ms  | 0.68ms   |
| 5                                      | 2000            | 1.11ms   | 0.909ms  | 0.5ms    |
| 10                                     | 1000            | 1.11ms   | 0.844ms  | 0.434ms  |
| 100                                    | 100             | 2.22ms   | 0.549ms  | 0.369ms  |
| 500                                    | 20              | 7.3ms    | 4.4ms    | 0.549ms  |
| 1000                                   | 10              | 10ms     | 4.2ms    | 0.483ms  |

We believe that the reason why 2 producers & 2 consumers have half the latency of 1 producer & consumer is because the Erlang TCP port driver needs to copy data from the VM to the port driver.
